**RGB** is currently a command-line application for performing essential linear algebra operations, created as a milestone project for the Linear Algebra and Geometry course at Institut Teknologi Bandung. It provides linear algebra utilities such as linear system solver, regression, interpolation, matrix transformations, and many more.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This release is just the beginning, and while many features work, some are still in development or may not be fully optimized.

## üìù Notes & Limitations
- This is an early version (v0.1.0). Not all operations are fully optimized, and some edge cases may not be handled gracefully.
- Matrix operations involving larger matrices might be slower or prone to formatting issues.
- Bicubic Spline Interpolation is functional but still requires more extensive testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Planned Improvements
- More robust error handling
- GUI version for more intuitive usage.
- Application on resizing image.
- Optimized performance for large matrices
- Extensive unit testing for more edge cases.
